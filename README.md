# Heart Disease Predictor Model
## Overview

![Screenshot 2024-03-11 13 54 55](https://github.com/mahn-bonnie/Heart-Disease-Predictor/assets/156321537/f65e159d-8157-4b2f-aea8-69cc3e94c10f)

Heart Disease Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various health-related features. The project utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to build an accurate predictive model.

# Features
Input features include:
 - Age
 - Gender
 - Chest pain type
 - Resting blood pressure
 - Serum cholesterol
 - Fasting blood sugar
 - Resting electrocardiographic results
 - Maximum heart rate achieved
 - Exercise-induced angina
 - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
 - Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
 - Thallium stress test result
   
Target variable: Presence or absence of heart disease

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
  
Install dependencies using:

 - bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
# Usage
# Clone the repository:
 - bash
git clone....
# Run the main script:
 - bash
python heart_disease_predictor.py

# Follow the on-screen instructions to input health-related data.
# Machine Learning Model
 - Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 - Model training and testing performed on the Heart Disease dataset.
# Files and Directories
 1. heart_disease_predictor.py: Main script for user interaction and prediction.
 2. model_svm_heart_disease: Pre-trained machine learning model saved using joblib.
 3. data/: Directory containing the Heart Disease dataset.
# Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 83% on the testing dataset.
